The Pepper Mill
===============

.. epigraph:: 

  *DÃ©formation professionnelle* is a French phrase, meaning a tendency to look at
  things from the point of view of one's own profession.

My friend Arach and I went to a restaurant for lunch. The waitress served us
food. She forgot the pepper mill and before bringing it she asked Arach if he
wanted some pepper.  Arach said yes. Then something completely unexpected
happened. Instead of going expeditiously for the pepper mill the waitress asked
me if I would like some pepper too.

This was so disturbing I was speechless! 

Everybody knows that when evaluating a boolean expression, the second term of an
`or` condition is not evaluated when the first term evaluates to a true value.

For example let's take the following code:

.. sourcecode:: python

  if AliceWantsPepper() or BobWantsPepper():
    BringThePepper()


In the previous code ``BobWantsPepper()`` MUST NOT be evaluated if
``AliceWantsPepper()`` is true. Any decent compiler works this way. I wrote
``pepper.py`` to prove it.

.. sourcecode:: python

  def AliceWantsPepper():
    print "Alice was asked about the pepper"
    return True

  def BobWantsPepper():
    print "Bob was asked about the pepper"
    return True

  shouldIBringThePepper = AliceWantsPepper() or BobWantsPepper()



Executing ``pepper.py`` prints

.. code-block:: console

  $ python pepper.py
  Alice was asked about the pepper

Only Alice was asked about the pepper. And here's the python byte code that
explains it all.

.. sourcecode:: console

  $ python -i pepper.py
  >>> import code
  >>> import dis
  >>> dis.dis(
  ... code.compile_command("AliceWantsPepper() or BobWantsPepper()"))
  1           0 LOAD_NAME                0 (AliceWantsPepper)
              3 CALL_FUNCTION            0
              6 JUMP_IF_TRUE             7 (to 16)
              9 POP_TOP             
             10 LOAD_NAME                1 (BobWantsPepper)
             13 CALL_FUNCTION            0
        >>   16 PRINT_EXPR          
             17 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
             20 RETURN_VALUE        
  

The ``JUMP_IF_TRUE`` to 16 is self-explanatory.  How will I ever go to this
restaurant again?
