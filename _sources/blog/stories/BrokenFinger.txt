Broken Finger
=============

One day we went to a playground. My niece Anna was climbing on a monkey bar and
dared me to climb too. I started to climb and hit a finger on a bar. The next
day the finger became red and swollen. 

I went to a hospital and waited four several hours in line. I came out with a
finger clip on my broken finger and was walking on the street when I noticed
the hospital wristband on my hand. In combination with a beard, long hair and
many sleepless nights (because of a new born baby) I looked like a detox
escapee in search of a dose. First I tried to rip the wristband but without
success. It was very strong. Then, I entered a random store and asked a
cashier, a tiny young woman, if she could be kind enough to cut that hospital
wristband. She couldn't find the scissors and proposed to rip it. I explained
to her that I tried but she insisted and said that she once ripped such a
wristband with her bare hands.

"You can do it!" she said.

It triggered a strange transformation. I took the wristband and ripped it as
if it was of paper. I was enlightened but made the "I knew I could do it" face
and went home.
